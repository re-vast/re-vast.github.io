The discover stage concerns working with domain experts to characterize and abstract problem, which is mapped to our problem abstraction component. The design stage involves designing an information visualization solution. However, in the context of visual analytics, it involves designing not only the visualization but also the data processing (data mining) methods. The last implement stage concerns implementing the system software prototype.
