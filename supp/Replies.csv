7,Inadequate discussion about related work,5,Y,Y,,1,

20,Over-complicated visual designs,5,Y,Y,"There is a tradeoff between novelty and complexity. Some VA systems hope to achieve novelty as the cost of complexity. This tradeoff has been a problem for the whole community. There exists a gap between research (even application papers) between actual applications.

26,Evaluations are incomplete and insufficient,5,Y,Y,"Traditionally speaking, evaluating VA systems is very complex and challenging.

31,Insights are suspicious or not new,5,N,Y,"The underlying problem is that VA systems do not have a standard.

2,Unclear relevance to visual analytics,6,Y,Y,"It is usually not a major concern since the boundary between VA and InfoVis systems is vague. However, the studied problem should be a pure computational problem. Let's say, the visualization should not just visualize the computed results.

4,Unclear contributions to the visualization community,6,N,N,"There are different research tastes. For me, a VA system should not be purely considered as a tool to the domain problem. There needs some take-away, guidelines, new visualization approaches, advice for the visualization design.",3,
5,Unclear novelty of VA systems,6,N,N,"Many papers are mixed type, contributing both VA systems and new VA designs. For application papers, I do not expect novel designs.

9,Unclear methodology and methods for problem abstraction,6,N,N,"There are three common methods: interview, fly-on-the-wall (observation), and in-between. The HCI community seems to prefer the second one (pure observation), which however might not be very applicable to VA systems. If we do not actively ask, experts might not report.",7,

13,Novel data processing algorithms,6,N,N,"It depends on whether the algorithm is closely integrated into the VA systems. If the algorithm can serve as a standalone paper, it should be split. If it is closely related (for example, algorithms that support real-time interaction), it should be appreciated.",4,
14,Unclear justifications of algorithms/models,6,N,N,"It is more important to clarify which algorithms are needed here, for example, the input and output. It is not so important to explain the specific choices since there are always many candidates.",2,

17,Unclear rationale and insufficient justifications of visual designs,6,N,Y,"This is an important problem. Sometimes it justifies the design by clearly stating the data type and task.

20,Over-complicated visual designs,6,Y,N,"This is a serious problem for the VA system to be actually used. The mental load of humans cannot afford over-complex designs.

It is important to provide walking-through tutorial and demo videos to help domain experts understand the design.",7,
21,Lacking workflow overviews or system demonstration,6,N,Y,The most important information is how to use multiple views to perform analysis. Some manuscripts just introduce each view one-by-one. This is insufficient.,7,

25,Usability,6,N,N,"Many evaluations are performed in the lab instead of out of the lab. It is meaningful to explore how VA systems fit into experts' workflow, to which degree do the system help, how frequently and how do experts use the system. Only a few papers explore this problem, but this practice is really meaningful to our domain.",2,Related to evaluation.
26,Evaluations are incomplete and insufficient,6,N,N,"This is a big problem. We need to appreciate visualization designs that are adapted out of the lab and in the everyday domain workflow. Currently we do not have alternative methods for evaluation, because the domain problem is complex.",2,

28,Lacking realism,6,N,N,"This is a problem. We currently evaluate the VA systems in the lab but not in the field. In-field evaluation needs more effort. The data and task cannot be arbitrarily set. Instead, they should be chosen for real scenarios.",4,
29,Lacking comparison with baseline approaches,6,Y,Y,"In general, we often can not find a fair baseline. We also lack a benchmark dataset/task. To move forward, we should abstract domain-specific problems into abstract tasks, and benchmark the abstraction. This can be feasible now since we have done so much research on domain problems.",2,
